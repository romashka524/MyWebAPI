    <description>This is the original Javascript compiler written in Javascript. It will be added to your Scripts folder and you'll have to reference it where you want it.
CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. Underneath all of those embarrassing braces and semicolons, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.</description>
